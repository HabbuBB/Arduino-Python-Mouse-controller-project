# DIY Mouse controller using Arduino and Python

This is a project I did as a hobby for myself. This repository will include the instructions on how to create it yourself, and is a small, fun project for beginners.

The finished product lets you control your mouse with the joystick.

It's a fun project to show to your friends. Watching people struggle with video games using this controller is a great activity.
